# Video Spyder – Research Smarter on YouTube

Video Spyder transforms YouTube into a powerful research tool. It's a sophisticated research assistant designed to turn YouTube from a passive video platform into a structured, searchable database of knowledge. Built for students, journalists, analysts, and content creators, it replaces hours of passive watching with an efficient workflow that extracts insights, organizes findings, and delivers structured data.

## Core Features

-   **Topic-Based Search**: Start with a broad subject (e.g., "climate policy," "machine learning basics") and gather relevant videos instantly.
-   **Grouped Results**: The system intelligently fetches and separates results into two distinct, clearly labeled categories: **Videos** and **YouTube Shorts**.
-   **AI Summaries at a Glance**: Each result features a dense, 2-3 sentence summary generated by the Gemini AI, enabling rapid triage.
-   **Key Moment Extraction**: The AI identifies and extracts the most important segments as clickable timestamps, allowing users to jump directly to the most valuable parts of a video.
-   **Transparency First**: A persistent banner reminds the user that all metadata (view counts, upload dates) is AI-estimated, encouraging verification and maintaining research integrity.
-   **Advanced Filtering**: Surgically narrow down search results by **Duration**, **Upload Date**, and **Minimum Views**.
-   **Project-Based Workflow**: Save entire search sessions—the query, filters, and all results—as named "Projects." Tag videos with statuses (Use / Review / Skip) and add per-video notes.
-   **Essential Researcher Tools**: Instantly export metadata to **CSV** or generate pre-formatted **APA** and **MLA** citations with a single click.
-   **Professional Android-Native UI**: The application is fully responsive with a polished, Material Design dark theme that feels at home on any Android device.
-   **Installable & Offline-Ready**: As a Progressive Web App (PWA), Video Spyder can be installed on your device's home screen and used even without an internet connection.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
-   **AI & Data Generation**: Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
-   **State Management**: React Hooks & Context API
-   **Persistence**: Browser LocalStorage for saving projects
-   **Offline Capability**: Service Workers for PWA functionality

## Publishing to the Google Play Store

This application is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, which is the modern, Google-recommended way to bring web applications to the Google Play Store. You can use a tool called a **Trusted Web Activity (TWA)** to wrap your PWA in a native Android shell.

Here is the general process:

### Prerequisites

1.  **Host the PWA**: Your application must be hosted on a public HTTPS server. You can use free services like [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) by simply dragging and dropping your project folder.
2.  **Generate App Icons**: The Play Store requires app icons in various sizes. The `manifest.json` file points to `logo-192.png` and `logo-512.png`. You can generate these from the `components/Logo.tsx` SVG file using an online SVG-to-PNG converter. Place these generated PNGs in the root directory of your project before deploying.
3.  **Install Android Studio**: You will need Android Studio to get the necessary Android SDKs. Download it from the [official Android developer website](https://developer.android.com/studio).

### Packaging with Bubblewrap

The easiest way to package your PWA is with Google's **Bubblewrap** command-line tool.

1.  **Install Bubblewrap**:
    ```bash
    npm install -g @bubblewrap/cli
    ```

2.  **Initialize Your Project**: Run the `init` command and point it to your deployed PWA's `manifest.json` file.
    ```bash
    # Replace the URL with your live PWA's manifest URL
    bubblewrap init --manifest https://your-live-pwa-url.com/manifest.json
    ```
    Bubblewrap will ask you a series of questions to configure your Android app (like package ID, version codes, etc.).

3.  **Build the Android App**: Once configured, run the build command.
    ```bash
    bubblewrap build
    ```
    This command will generate a signed **Android App Bundle (`.aab`)** file, which is what you upload to the Google Play Console. It will also help you generate the `assetlinks.json` file that you need to upload to your web host to verify domain ownership.

4.  **Publish**: Create a Google Play Developer account, create a new app listing, and upload your `.aab` file.

## Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **API Key Configuration**: This project requires a Google Gemini API key. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your key:
    ```
    API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
    ```
    *Note: A build tool is required to inject this environment variable. For simple local development, you can temporarily hardcode it in `services/geminiService.ts`, but **do not commit this to version control.**

3.  **Install a local server**:
    ```bash
    npm install -g serve
    ```

4.  **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    serve .
    ```
    Open your web browser to the URL provided (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
